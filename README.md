👋 Hi, I’m @JafarSoltani9  
👀 I’m interested in IT, programming, and computer technology, particularly in expanding my skills in software development and technical problem solving.  
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in programming (Java, Python), web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and gaining further experience with tools like Git and Visual Studio Code.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software development projects, web development, and any IT-related challenges where I can contribute with my skills and grow further.
